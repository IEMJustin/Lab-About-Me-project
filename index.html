<h2>Biography</h2>

<p>
        My name is Joseph, I was born in Seattle and currently live here. I have 2 dogs (Wiley & Luna) and enjoy going out and doing things in the outdoors such as going on walks, biking, snowboarding, and being out on the water. 
    My brother and my mother are both software developers and I have always had an affinity towards tech and am excited to pursue a career in it. 
    I graduated from Raisbeck Aviation High School and have worked the last couple summers making deliveries for a distribution company. My goal is to try and get a deep understanding of the information
